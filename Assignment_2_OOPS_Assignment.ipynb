    " Method Overloading in Python\n",
    "Definition:\n",
    "Method overloading refers to defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters \n",
    "(different number of arguments or different types of arguments).\n",
    "🔹 Python does not support traditional method overloading as seen in languages like Java and C++, \n",
    "where multiple methods with the same name can coexist based on their parameter lists.\n",
    "🔹 Instead, Python handles this using default arguments (*args, **kwargs) or function overloading via conditionals inside the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "How It Works in Python:\n",
    "Instead of defining multiple add() methods, we use a default parameter (c=0) to make it flexible.\n",
    "We could also use *args for an arbitrary number of parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Method Overriding in Python\n",
    "Definition:\n",
    "Method overriding occurs when a child class provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 The method in the child class must have the same name as the parent class’s method.\n",
    "🔹 The child class’s method replaces the parent class’s method when called on an instance of the child.\n",
    "🔹 The super() function can be used to call the overridden method from the parent.\n",

    "Definition:\n",
    "Overloading: Multiple methods with the same name but different numbers or types of parameters.\n",
    "Overriding: A method in a child class replaces a method with the same name in the parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Support in Python:\n",
    "Overloading: Not directly supported (simulated using default arguments, *args, or conditionals).\n",
    "Overriding: Fully supported in Python inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of Parameters:\n",
    "Overloading: Methods differ by the number or type of parameters.\n",
    "Overriding: The method signature (name and parameters) remains the same as the parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Behavior:\n",
    "Overloading: The appropriate method is selected based on arguments passed.\n",
    "Overriding: The child class method completely replaces the parent class method when called on a child object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance Requirement:\n",
    "Overloading: Can be done within a single class (not inheritance-based).\n",
    "Overriding: Requires a parent-child relationship (inheritance).\n",
    "\n",
    "Use of super():\n",
    "Overloading: Not applicable.\n",
    "Overriding: super() can be used to call the parent class method inside the overridden method.\n",
